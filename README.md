## How it Works

The application follows these steps:

- Splash Screen: Displays a splash screen for 3 seconds before redirecting to the input screen.
- Input Screen: Users input the number of rows (m) and columns (n) for the matrix. Once confirmed, users are redirected to the matrix screen.
- Matrix Screen: Users fill in each cell of the matrix with a single character. Autofocus moves to the next cell once a character is entered. After completing the matrix, users can continue to the result screen.
- Result Screen: Displays the filled matrix. Users can search for specific characters within the matrix using the search field. Matches are highlighted in yellow. Users can also reset the process.
